    "# Ans. \n",
    "- String slicing is a technique in Python that allows you to extract a portion (substring) of a string by\n",
    "  specifying a range of indices.\n",
    "  It’s a powerful way to manipulate strings and access specific parts of them easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax for string slicing is:\n",
    "\n",
    "substring = string[start:stop:step]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`start`**: The index at which the slice starts (inclusive).\n",
    "- **`stop`**: The index at which the slice stops (exclusive).\n",
    "- **`step`**: The step size, which specifies how many characters to skip between each character in the slice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple Slicing**\n",
    "\n",
    "   text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "   print(text[0:5])  # Output: 'Hello'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, the slice starts at index 0 and stops just before index 5, extracting \"Hello\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Omitting Start and Stop**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If you omit the `start`, it defaults to the beginning of the string.\n",
    "   - If you omit the `stop`, it defaults to the end of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(text[:5])   # Output: 'Hello' (from start to index 5)\n",
    "   print(text[7:])   # Output: 'World!' (from index 7 to the end)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Negative Indices**\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can use negative indices to count from the end of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(text[-6:])  # Output: 'World!' (last 6 characters)\n",
    "   print(text[:-7])  # Output: 'Hello, ' (all except last 7 characters)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using Step**\n",
    "\n",
    "   The `step` parameter specifies the interval between characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(text[::2])  # Output: 'Hlo ol!' (every second character)\n",
    "   print(text[::-1]) # Output: '!dlroW ,olleH' (reverses the string)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Extracting Substrings with Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can use steps to skip characters or reverse the substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(text[1:8:2])  # Output: 'el,' (start at index 1, stop before 8, step by 2)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Uses of String Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extracting Substrings**: Useful for breaking down text into smaller parts.\n",
    "- **Reversing Strings**: A common task that can be easily done using `[::-1]`.\n",
    "- **Skipping Characters**: Useful in scenarios like processing every nth character.\n"

    "# Ans. \n",
    "- Lists are one of the most versatile and commonly used data structures in Python.\n",
    "  They are used to store collections of items in a single variable and can hold different data types,\n",
    "  such as integers, floats, strings, and even other lists. Here are the key features of lists in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ** ordered **\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists maintain the order of elements, which means that the items have a specific position or index.\n",
    "  The first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# example \n",
    "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
    "print(fruits[0])  # Output: 'apple'\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ** Mutable **\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed after creation.\n",
    "  You can add, remove, or modify elements within a list.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# example\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "numbers[1] = 20\n",
    "print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 20, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ** Dynamic Size **\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists in Python can grow or shrink in size as needed.\n",
    "  You can add or remove elements without worrying about declaring a fixed size.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# example \n",
    "names = ['Alice', 'Bob']\n",
    "names.append('Charlie')\n",
    "print(names)  # Output: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ** Heterogeneous Elements **\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists can contain elements of different data types, including integers, strings, floats,\n",
    "  and even other lists (nested lists).\n",
    "    \n",
    "# examples \n",
    "mixed_list = [1, \"hello\", 3.14, [5, 6]]\n",
    "print(mixed_list)  # Output: [1, 'hello', 3.14, [5, 6]]\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ** Indexing and Slicing **\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can access individual elements of a list using indexing, and you can extract sublists using slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# examples\n",
    "colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow']\n",
    "print(colors[2])    # Output: 'blue'\n",
    "print(colors[1:3])  # Output: ['green', 'blue']\n",
    "\n",
    "6. ** Comprehensive Built-in Functions and Methods **\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists have a wide range of built-in methods like\n",
    "  append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), pop(), clear(), index(), count(), sort(), and reverse(),\n",
    "  which make them extremely powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "# example \n",
    "\n",
    " nums = [5, 2, 9, 1]\n",
    " nums.sort()\n",
    " print(nums)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "7. ** Iteration **\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists can be easily iterated using loops, such as for loops, making them ideal for processing collections of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# examples \n",
    "for fruit in ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']:\n",

    "# Output:\n",
    "# apple\n",
    "# banana\n",
    "# cherry\n",
    "\n",
    "8. ** List comprehensions **\n",
    "\n",
    " -Python provides a concise way to create lists using list comprehensions, which can make code more readable and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "# examples \n",
    "squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]\n",
    "print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "\n",
    "9. ** Supports Nesting ** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists can contain other lists as elements, allowing the creation of multi-dimensional data structures like matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "# examples \n",
    "matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n",
    "print(matrix[1][2])  # Output: 6\n",
    "\n",
    "10. ** Variable length **\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since lists are dynamic, they can vary in length and do not require a pre-declared size.\n",
    "\n",
    "# example\n",
    "empty_list = []\n",
    "empty_list.append('Python')\n",
    "print(empty_list)  # Output: ['Python']\n",

    "- Tuples and lists are both fundamental data structures in Python that allow you to store collections of items.\n",
    "  However, they have some key differences in terms of mutability, syntax, performance, and use cases.\n",

    "### Examples of Using Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating a Set**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Sets are defined using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "   fruits = {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}\n",
    "   print(fruits)  # Output: {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Using set() to create an empty set\n",
    "   empty_set = set()\n",
    "   print(empty_set)  # Output: set()\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adding Elements to a Set**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Use the `add()` method to add a single element, or `update()` to add multiple elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "   fruits.add('date')\n",
    "   print(fruits)  # Output: {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date'}\n",
    "   \n",
    "   fruits.update(['elderberry', 'fig', 'grape'])\n",
    "   print(fruits)  # Output: {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry', 'fig', 'grape'}\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Removing Elements from a Set**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Use `remove()` to remove a specific element (raises an error if the element is not found) or `discard()` (which does not raise an error if the element is not found). Use `pop()` to remove and return an arbitrary element.\n",
    "\n",
    "   fruits.remove('banana')  # Removes 'banana'\n",
    "   print(fruits)  # Output: {'apple', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry', 'fig', 'grape'}\n",

    "   print('cherry' in fruits)  # Output: True\n",
    "   print('banana' in fruits)  # Output: False\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Set Operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Union** (`|` or `union()`): Combines elements from both sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "     set_a = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "     set_b = {3, 4, 5}\n",

    "     print(set_a.union(set_b))  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Intersection** (`&` or `intersection()`): Returns elements common to both sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "     print(set_a & set_b)             # Output: {3}\n",
    "     print(set_a.intersection(set_b)) # Output: {3}\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Difference** (`-` or `difference()`): Returns elements in the first set but not in the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "     print(set_a - set_b)            # Output: {1, 2}\n",
    "     print(set_a.difference(set_b))  # Output: {1, 2}\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Symmetric Difference** (`^` or `symmetric_difference()`): Returns elements in either set, but not in both.\n",
    "\n",
    "     print(set_a ^ set_b)                      # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}\n",
    "     print(set_a.symmetric_difference(set_b))  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Removing Duplicates from a List**\n",
    "\n",
    "   One common use of sets is to remove duplicates from a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\n",

    "\n",
    "   Sets are useful in scenarios such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Filtering Unique Items**: Quickly find unique items in a collection.\n",

    "In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable types, such as strings, numbers,\n",

    "    \n",
    "#  Importance of Dictionary Keys Being Immutable\n",
    "#  1. Consistency in Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reason: Dictionaries use a hash table to store key-value pairs.When you add a key to a dictionary,\n",
    "  Python computes a hash value for the key. This hash value is used to determine where the key-value pair\n",
    "  should be stored in the memory. If the key were mutable (and thus could change after being used as a key),\n",
    "  its hash value would also change, leading to inconsistencies in data retrieval.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Outcome: Immutability ensures that the hash value of the key remains constant throughout the\n",
    "  lifecycle of the dictionary, guaranteeing reliable data access.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# 2. Data Integrity   \n",
    "\n",
    "- Reason: If keys were mutable, changing the key after it has been added to the dictionary would cause problems \n",
    "  with locating the item. This could lead to lost data or incorrect behavior, as the dictionary would no longer know\n",
    "  where to find the value associated with the changed key.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outcome: Using immutable keys ensures that once a key-value pair is added, \n",
    "  it remains correctly indexed and accessible.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# 3. Efficiency\n",
    "- Reason: Immutability allows dictionaries to optimize the storage and retrieval of key-value pairs.\n",
    "  Since immutable objects cannot change, the dictionary does not have to handle the complexity of keys\n",
    "  altering after insertion.\n",

    "- Outcome: This optimization keeps dictionaries fast and memory-efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples\n",
